# Shadertoy XAPI
This repository is a collection of python libraries and documentation
for the Shadertoy Public API and the internal API used by shadertoy.com
(which I call the extended API or XAPI for short).\
**Important note: the extended API is undocumented and unstable, use it with caution.**\
To run a test, make sure you are in the root directory of this repo and run this command:
```sh
./testrun.sh general_api_test.py # Or some other test file
```
